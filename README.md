## About The Project

#### A Complete App for Mental Health Help

[Heart-To-Heart](https://heart-to-heart-frontend.vercel.app/) is a modern-day designed, enhanced user experience, multi-functional, mobile ready app developed to help people improve their mental health and get a fresh motivation.

> Many people find it difficult to reach other out for help for any mental issues,
> they have a fear in their minds to be judged,
> they don't get a proper solution to recover


#### Our Solution

In our project, we have focussed on creating a platform where a person can vent out his/her thoughts, emotions or feelings. S/he can know their analysis of their emotions and how they feel at the moment. We have used Symbl.AI to analyze the sentiments and provide a report which they can send anonymously to a therapist and seek help. Apart from that we have developed certain features in our app which would help a person to recover and improve his/her mental health such as a 21 Days Challenge feature, pen-down-your-thoughts feature, a chatbot, a music player and motivational resources feature.
